Hello!
I learned about branches and their uses in GitHub. Branches are very useful to work on different 
areas on a main project without changing the main project. Branches are copies of the project 
where collaborator can work on idea that may or may not be ready. After the code is done, a pull 
request can be made to review and make comments before deploying the code into the main project.
If there is an error, we can rollback to fix the error before trying again. 

I also learned what a markown file is (.md). It is a file type that is a lightweight markup 
language that can be converted to text. The ReadMe.md I created for this lab is a md file.
